        - introduces the throttle-binding behaviour with an interval of 850ms, that is the input value is notified to the view-model once every 850ms: value.bind="bookTitle & throttle:850"
        - binding expression modified to include the debounce binding behaviour, that is the input value is notified to the view-model only after the user stopped typing for 850ms: value.bind="bookTitle & debounce:850"
        - binding expression modified to include the updateTrigger binding behaviour, that is the input value is notified to the view-model only when the user click or tab away from the input field (blur): value.bind="bookTitle & updateTrigger:'blur'"
        - adds a blur trigger to fire the new signal when the user tabs away and changes the value.bind expression back to the basic two-way binding, that is the submit input button's disabled attribute is notified to the view-model based on the custome event/signal: can-add-signal, which is fired when the input box is blurred away (click or tab out):
          blur.trigger="refreshSignal()"
